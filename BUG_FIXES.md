# Bug Fixes Summary - SCORE.py ID Methods

## Bugs Fixed

### 1. **find_by_id() - Wrong field accessor for Pydantic models**
**Issue**: Used `Event.__dataclass_fields__` instead of `Event.__fields__`
- Event is a Pydantic BaseModel, not a dataclass
- `__dataclass_fields__` doesn't exist on Pydantic models
- Caused AttributeError when trying to find events

**Fix**: Changed to `Event.__fields__.keys()` (Pydantic v2 syntax)

### 2. **delete_by_id() - Same issue as find_by_id()**
**Issue**: Used `Event.__dataclass_fields__` instead of `Event.__fields__`
- Same root cause as find_by_id()
- Would fail when trying to delete events

**Fix**: Changed to `Event.__fields__.keys()`

### 3. **renumber_id() - Incomplete implementation**
**Issue**: Only renumbered events in staves, missed linebreaks
- LineBreak objects have IDs and should be renumbered
- Started renumbering from 0 instead of 1

**Fix**: 
- Added renumbering for linebreaks
- Changed reset to start from 1 instead of 0
- Added comment clarifying basegrids don't have IDs

### 4. **add_basegrid() - Passing non-existent parameters**
**Issue**: Tried to pass ID and styling parameters that Basegrid doesn't accept
- Basegrid class doesn't have id, gridlineColor, barlineColor, etc.
- These parameters were being ignored

**Fix**: Simplified to only pass the parameters that Basegrid actually accepts

### 5. **Pydantic forward reference issue**
**Issue**: Stave class instantiation failed due to unresolved forward references
- Creating Stave() in default_factory lambda caused errors
- Event/Stave/SCORE models needed rebuilding

**Fix**:
- Changed stave field to use empty list default_factory
- Added stave creation in __init__ method
- Added model_rebuild() calls for all Pydantic models at module level

## Test Coverage

Created comprehensive test suite (`tests/test_id_methods.py`) covering:
- ✅ find_by_id() for all event types
- ✅ delete_by_id() functionality
- ✅ renumber_id() with gaps in IDs
- ✅ ID persistence through save/load cycles
- ✅ Edge cases (non-existent IDs, etc.)

All tests pass successfully!
